### Conversion Strategy

1. Convert entire Java \& LWJGL codebase to C# \& Unity.
2. Do a second pass to remove placeholders and convert library functions to Unity equivalents.
3. Do a third pass to remove obsolete / unused files and code.
4. Do a fourth pass to fix any remaining compilation issues.
