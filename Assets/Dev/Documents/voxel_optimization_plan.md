# Voxel Chunk GPU Optimization Plan

## Current System Analysis
- **Existing Implementation**: CPU-based greedy mesh algorithm combining block vertices within chunks
- **Strengths**: Effective mesh reduction within chunks, good visual quality
- **Limitations**: High triangle count for distant geometry, potential draw call overhead

## Optimization Strategy Overview

### Core Principle
Chunk updates occur primarily near players, allowing for a distance-based detail system where nearby chunks maintain high fidelity while distant chunks use simplified representations.

## Level of Detail (LOD) System

### LOD Levels
- **LOD 0 (0-50m)**: Full detail with current greedy meshing
- **LOD 1 (50-100m)**: Simplified mesh, 2x2x2 block groups → single quads
- **LOD 2 (100-200m)**: Very low poly representation, major features only
- **LOD 3 (200m+)**: Chunk boundary boxes or culled entirely

### Graphics Preset Integration
- **Ultra**: LOD transitions at 75m, 150m, 300m
- **High**: LOD transitions at 50m, 100m, 200m (default)
- **Medium**: LOD transitions at 30m, 75m, 150m
- **Low**: LOD transitions at 20m, 50m, 100m

## Seed-Based Chunk Generation System

### Overview
Implement deterministic chunk generation using seeds to minimize network bandwidth and server resources. Natural terrain chunks are generated client-side from seeds, while only player modifications require server synchronization.

### Network Protocol Optimization

#### Chunk Types
- **Natural Chunks**: Generated from seed, send only `(chunkCoord, seed)` - 8 bytes
- **Modified Chunks**: Player-altered, send `(chunkCoord, -1, compressedVoxelData)` - ~1-32KB
- **Partial Updates**: Delta compression for small modifications

#### Bandwidth Comparison
- **Traditional**: 32³ × 1 byte = 32,768 bytes per chunk
- **Seed-based**: 8 bytes per natural chunk (99.975% reduction)
- **Network savings**: Massive reduction in initial world loading and exploration

### Implementation Strategy

#### Client-Side Generation
1. **Receive seed** from server for chunk coordinates
2. **Generate voxel data** using deterministic noise functions
3. **Apply LOD algorithms** locally using generated data
4. **Cache results** to avoid regeneration

#### Server-Side Management
- **Store only modifications**: Track chunks altered by players
- **Seed validation**: Ensure client/server generation consistency
- **Modification tracking**: Mark chunks with seed = -1 when altered
- **Compression**: Use delta compression for partial modifications

### Integration with LOD System

#### Consistent Generation
- **Same algorithms**: Identical noise functions on client/server
- **LOD from seed**: Generate appropriate detail level directly from seed
- **No sync needed**: LOD calculations are deterministic across all clients

#### Memory Efficiency
- **On-demand generation**: Create only needed LOD levels
- **Streaming**: Generate chunks as players approach
- **Garbage collection**: Clean up distant chunk data while keeping seeds

### Procedural Content Support

#### Natural Structures
- **Asteroids**: Size, shape, and composition from chunk seed
- **Planets**: Terrain features, biomes, and resources
- **Ore deposits**: Consistent mineral distribution
- **Caverns**: Tunnel systems and underground features

#### Structure Persistence
- **Cross-chunk structures**: Use world seed for large formations
- **Consistent boundaries**: Ensure structures align across chunk borders
- **Scalable complexity**: More detail in higher LOD levels

### Server Architecture Benefits

#### Resource Optimization
- **Minimal storage**: Only store world seed + player modifications
- **Reduced CPU**: No generation needed for unmodified chunks
- **Scalable**: Support many more concurrent players
- **Backup efficiency**: World state is mostly just a seed + deltas

#### Headless Server Advantages
- **No rendering**: Generate data without GPU/graphics context
- **Lightweight**: Minimal memory footprint for natural terrain
- **Fast startup**: No need to pre-generate world data
- **Easy clustering**: Multiple servers can handle same world regions

## GPU Implementation Strategies

### Phase 1: Compute Shader LOD Generation
```
Inputs: Full voxel chunk data
Process: Generate simplified mesh data at multiple LOD levels
Outputs: LOD meshes stored in GPU buffers
```

### Phase 2: Chunk Mesh Combining
- Combine adjacent chunks at same LOD level into larger meshes
- Reduce draw calls from 30+ chunks to 3-5 combined meshes
- Handle chunk updates by rebuilding affected combined mesh regions

### Phase 3: GPU Culling and Selection
```
Compute Shader Pipeline:
1. Frustum culling per chunk
2. Distance-based LOD selection
3. Visibility determination
4. Indirect draw command generation
```

## Technical Implementation

```

### Rendering Pipeline
1. **GPU Culling Pass**: Determine visible chunks and required LOD
2. **Mesh Selection**: Choose appropriate LOD mesh for each visible chunk
3. **Indirect Rendering**: Use `Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect` for simplified chunks
4. **Combined Mesh Rendering**: Draw larger combined meshes for nearby detailed areas

## Memory Management

### GPU Buffer Strategy

## CPU Fallback System

### Fallback Scenarios

- **LOD 1**: CPU-based mesh simplification using vertex decimation
- **LOD 2**: Coarse voxel sampling (4x4x4 blocks → single quad)
- **LOD 3**: Bounding box representation only

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Process only visible chunks
- **Time-sliced Updates**: Spread LOD generation across multiple frames
- **Priority System**: Update nearest chunks first
- **Caching**: Store generated LOD meshes to avoid regeneration

### Hybrid Approach (GPU + CPU)

#### Smart System Detection
```csharp
public enum ProcessingMode
{
    FullGPU,      // All operations on GPU
    HybridGPU,    // GPU for generation, CPU for combining
    HybridCPU,    // CPU for generation, GPU for rendering
    FullCPU       // All operations on CPU
}
```

#### Automatic Fallback Logic
1. **System Detection**: Check GPU compute capability at startup
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Detect GPU performance issues during runtime
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Automatically switch to CPU when needed
4. **User Override**: Allow manual selection in graphics settings

### Server Considerations

#### Headless Server Optimization
- **No Rendering**: Generate mesh data without GPU context
- **Network Optimization**: Send LOD-appropriate data to clients
- **Memory Efficiency**: Store only necessary LOD levels
